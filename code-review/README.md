## Foreword

I intend code review templates to have only some of their content used all the time. At first, using unabridged templates to set expectations for new teams and team members is helpful. But in time, you will see consistency on specific items and only need to focus on things your team struggles with.

> ðŸ‘‰ _Comments to the reviewer on templates are annotated._

Checkboxes are pre-marked to save you time. Ideally, change request authors will address most entries, so it _should_ be less work for the reviewer to uncheck them.

One day, it will become unnecessary for you to publish templates on change requests; they will transition to a companion to your code review. In the fullness of times, an "LGTM" will be all you need to publish. On that note, here is a quote that captures the spirit of the templates:

 ### [End the debate once and for all. Do writing the objectives on the board do anything?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/10vq3sn/end_the_debate_once_and_for_all_do_writing_the/j7iz4g1/?context=3)

> _You can't see inside your kids' minds to know if they are learning. So you design imperfect and sometimes even arbitrary and burdensome mechanisms to assess their learning and compliance. If all your kids were earnest and focused, many of these mechanisms would not be necessary._

> _Admin cannot see inside your mind to make sure teachers are following their objectives. So they implement imperfect and sometimes even arbitrary and burdensome mechanisms to assess whether the teachers actually have plans. If all your teacher colleagues were earnest and followed through, many of these mechanism would not be necessary._

> _For the first 90 seconds of class I have trained my 7th and 8th graders to assume total silence upon the bell and copy the objective into their planner. Does this help them learn? Not really. But it is a powerful management tool to calm and quiet the class, make sure they have a pencil in hand, and then quickly transition their attention to our first lesson activity._

> _But why not do a warm up? Because kids were absent and don't know, can't do the warm up, etc. and then they cause problems. What can everyone do no matter what? Everyone can copy a sentence off the board._
