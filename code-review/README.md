## Foreword

This document is not intended to have all it's content used all the time. Take excerpts from it on each code review you perform to develop a thorough culture on your team. In full, this document is also helpful to set proper expectations for new members of your team.

ðŸ‘‰ _Notes to the reviewer are italicized and marked by emojis, and are not intended for the receiving audience. I recommend removing them before publishing._

Checkboxes are pre-marked to save you time. Ideally, most items will be addressed by change request authors, so it _should_ be less work to uncheck items, rather than check them.

Overtime, the goal of this document is to not be used at all. In the fullness of times, a "LGTM" will be all you need. On that note, here is a quote that captures the spirit of this document:

 ### [End the debate once and for all. Do writing the objectives on the board do anything?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/10vq3sn/end_the_debate_once_and_for_all_do_writing_the/j7iz4g1/?context=3)

> _You can't see inside your kids' minds to know if they are learning. So you design imperfect and sometimes even arbitrary and burdensome mechanisms to assess their learning and compliance. If all your kids were earnest and focused, many of these mechanisms would not be necessary._

> _Admin cannot see inside your mind to make sure teachers are following their objectives. So they implement imperfect and sometimes even arbitrary and burdensome mechanisms to assess whether the teachers actually have plans. If all your teacher colleagues were earnest and followed through, many of these mechanism would not be necessary._

> _For the first 90 seconds of class I have trained my 7th and 8th graders to assume total silence upon the bell and copy the objective into their planner. Does this help them learn? Not really. But it is a powerful management tool to calm and quiet the class, make sure they have a pencil in hand, and then quickly transition their attention to our first lesson activity._

> _But why not do a warm up? Because kids were absent and don't know, can't do the warm up, etc. and then they cause problems. What can everyone do no matter what? Everyone can copy a sentence off the board._
