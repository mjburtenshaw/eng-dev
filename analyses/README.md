## Foreword

A task analysis is a process used to verify that you understand the desired outcome of a task and how to achieve it.

At the highest level, it asks the following questions:
- What's the task?
- Why are we doing this?
- How will we do it?
- How do we know if it works?

You should be able to answer all these questions before making changes. It forces you to answer unknowns about implementation. In addition, having a clear solution and validation leads to healthy development by reducing scope creep and keeping commits small.

If you can't answer those questions, that indicates a research task should be completed first.

## Extensions

 - **h _n_**: headers start at _n_. Having sub-levels is handy for a quick copy/paste into another markdown document.
